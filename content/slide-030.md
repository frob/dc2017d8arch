  notes:
  - What is an LMS? An LMS is a Learning Management System.
  - It is software that allows for the organization and delivery of courses or training programs. If you have used buildamodule.com or drupalize.me then you have used a LMS.
  - Traditional LMS/Course schema
    - Curriculum or Lesson plan
      - Unit or Module
        - Lesson/Project/Assesment/Mini-lessons
  - Our custom LMS is structured as
    - module -> menu
      - segments -> nodes
        - components -> paragraphs items
