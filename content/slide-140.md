  notes:
    - What needs to change?
    - not much
    - This site works more like a an app than a traditional site, this means we have slightly different expectations when choosing a Framework.
    - Drupal was chosen for its scaleability, strong user centric or permissions based content model, high quality contrib space, and familiarity. As I said before I have been doing drupal professionally for close to 10 years, so I am very familiar with the project, community, and workflow. However, I am constantly looking into other technology and I have built things with other tech when Drupal isn't the best choice, so this isn't a statement coming from the island.
    - Drupal 8 has lots of new Features but the biggest advances have been in underlying architecture (with the content/config entity system) and development workflow (with the switch to Semantic Versioning).

    - Architecturally the site remains the same
      - The site has the same features and the same modules are available to provide us with the same architecture and content strategy.

      - The largest change is the addition of developing a stable release for whatever we use for the response saving.
