  note:
    - This is not a block heavy site
    - It works mostly as an app with the blocks only really being used to place active menues on the screen.
    - This is mainly because there are not many reusable pieces to the site. If it isn't a page level thing then it really isn't a part of this site.
    - This site doesn't use blocks, but when I use blocks I build them with BEAN.
    - Bean gives us all the functionality of building content types with nodes except with blocks instead.
    - I normally add a content view for beans at /admin/content/blocks and I disable the default drupal block management stuff, with the exception of block placement. because that is still necessary.
    - But again, this site didn't make heavy use of blocks.
