  notes:
  - In the end our site had 13 paragraphs item bundles for 1 content type
  - Four where interactive
    - Text response
    - Checkbox list
    - Drag and Drop
  - Four where used for custom inter and intra module navigation
  - The rest where videos, image, and text.
  - all can be combined to form larger whole components.
  - Each interactive paragraphs item had a corresponding entity form with an entity reference back to the paragraphs item that displayed the form.
    - Slightly complicated, using Drupal's genius render array system that doesn't care if it is displaying a form, or content, or anything themable, we where able to HULK smash the entityforms into the paragraphs item displays and save any users response and know what they where responding to and who was responding to it. Very cool stuff.
  - It gets even better. Our client wanted users to be able to self evaluate their responses. So we have flags that let the users share their responses, in turn if they share their response then they see their peer's responses.
